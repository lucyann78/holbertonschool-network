This document aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of key networking concepts. First, we will explore localhost and its IP address 127.0.0.1, which refers to the local machine and is essential for testing network applications locally. Next, we will discuss 0.0.0.0, a special address indicating all IPv4 addresses on the local machine, commonly used in server configurations. Additionally, we will examine the /etc/hosts file, which maps hostnames to IP addresses, facilitating local DNS resolution. Finally, we will learn how to display your machineâ€™s active network interfaces, an important step in troubleshooting and network configuration.
